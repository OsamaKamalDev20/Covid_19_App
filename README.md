# ðŸŒŸCOVID-19 App ðŸŒŸ
I'm thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve successfully developed a **COVID-19 Tracking App** as part of my journey to deepen my skills in **Flutter development** and explore the power of **API integration**.  

The app provides real-time updates on COVID-19 statistics, including:  
##### ðŸ“Œ **Global and country-specific cases** (updated, total deaths, active cases, recovered, world populations and total test taken).  
##### ðŸ“Œ Preventive measures to help users stay safe.  

This project was an excellent opportunity to:  
##### âœ… Utilize RESTful APIs for real-time data retrieval.  
##### âœ… Implement dynamic, responsive UI components.  
##### âœ… Optimize performance for seamless user experience.  
##### âœ… Animations and Shimmer Effects

The following are features of this App:
#### âœ… Splash Screen
consists of an animated logo.
#### âœ… The Onboarding Screen 
consists of Lottie's animation, title, and description.
#### âœ…Home Screen
consists of worldwide stats (updated, total cases, total deaths, active cases, recovered, world populations, and total tests taken). 
#### âœ…Country List Screen
consists of COVID-19 countries with search functionality and shimmer effect. 
#### âœ… Country Detail Screen
consists of country details such (as name, continent, population, description, COVID-19 Stats {total cases, recovered, total deaths, and active cases}).


## ðŸ’» Tech Stack: Flutter, Dart, RESTful APIs, JSON  
## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: To create a user-friendly tool for health awareness and information accessibility.
